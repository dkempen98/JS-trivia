# JS-Trivia

Timed trivia game with high score tracking and a timer.

## Description

The trivia game goes through some JS history and primarily runs on JS functions.

Every correct answer results in 10 points being added to your total.

The running clock starts at 60 seconds and loses 10 seconds for every wrong answer.

Every second left on the clock at the end of the game is added to your total score.

After every game, you can enter your initials and your score will show up on your own local leaderboard.

## Usage

This is a fun exercise in learning some history of JS in a program that runs almost entirely on JS
